# Bhagaskara_company_website
Remake of a company website template, using skills learned during the Coderslab course

I wrote the entire code for the website that would look like the template available here: (https://w3layouts.com/bhagaskara-onepage-multipurpose-flat-bootstrap-responsive-web-template/).
However, I changed many elements to make it more usable/aesthetic and I added responsiveness.
